# Project 2: Variational Quantum Monte Carlo

Written by Kadhim al Zubi and Achmed Marif.

This reposotory uses Variational Monte Carlo Integration to obtain the ground state energies of certain systems. The systems given here are: Harmonic Oscillator,
Hydrogen atom and the Helium atom.

- To obtain groundstate energies for a range of variational parameter alpha run [`variational_monte_carlo.py`](https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/computational_physics_projects/Project-2---QMC_N_mido1/-/blob/master/variational_monte_carlo.py).
Type in the system that you want to examine in the System parameter in the file. Please choose between: Oscillator, Hydrogen or Helium.

- To perform proper minimization of the ground state for a given initial value of alpha run [`optimal_energy.py `](https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/computational_physics_projects/Project-2---QMC_N_mido1/-/blob/master/optimal_energy.py).
