# Weekly progress journal

## Instructions

In this journal you will document your progress of the project, making use of weekly milestones. In contrast to project 1, you will need to define yourself detailed milestones.

Every week you should 

1. define **on Wednesday** detailed milestones for the week (according to the
   high-level milestones listed in the review issue).
   Then make a short plan of how you want to 
   reach these milestones. Think about how to distribute work in the group, 
   what pieces of code functionality need to be implemented. 
2. write about your progress **before** the Tuesday in the next week with
   respect to the milestones. Substantiate your progress with links to code,
   pictures or test results. Reflect on the relation to your original plan.

Note that there is a break before the deadline of the first week review
issue. Hence the definition of milestones and the plan for week 1 should be
done on or before 15 April.

We will give feedback on your progress on Tuesday before the following lecture. Consult the 
[grading scheme](https://computationalphysics.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/proj2-grading/) 
for details how the journal enters your grade.

Note that the file format of the journal is *markdown*. This is a flexible and easy method of 
converting text to HTML. 
Documentation of the syntax of markdown can be found 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gfm-extends-standard-markdown). 
You will find how to include [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links) and 
[images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#images) particularly
useful.

## Week 1
- At first the harmonic oscillator wull be considered since the trial wavefunction for such system is known in the literature. By Achmed 

- The trial wave function will be $\exp{-{\alpha}x^{2}}$. For the harmonic oscillator there is already a data of numerical data to compare with in the book of Dr.J.Thijssen. By Kadhim 

- The trial wavefunction will be used in the local energy to get a valid expression. By Achmed

-The Monte carlo method is then used to calculate the integral by summing over the samples obtained by the Metropolis smapling mehtod. By Kadhim
